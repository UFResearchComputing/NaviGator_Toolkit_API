# NaviGator Toolkit API Examples 

![NaviGator log](navigator.png)

 [NaviGator Toolkit](https://it.ufl.edu/ai/navigator-toolkit/) is an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)-compatible tool that provides API access to large language models such as Llama, and Mixtral. Image generation models like Flux and speech-to-text models like Whisper are also available.

Faculty and staff can set up accounts to access cloud models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude. 

This repository has examples of how to use the Toolkit.
